# Generative-Plagiarism-Detection
This code is designed for generative plagiarism detection. The input consists of data pairs from suspicious documents (susp) and source documents (src), while the output is an XML file containing the offset and length of plagiarized segments. The models used include all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, and bert_base_uncased_finetuned. The models all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and all-mpnet-base-v2 can be downloaded from the Hugging Face model repository. The bert_base_uncased_finetuned model is available at https://huggingface.co/SuZongbao/bert_base_uncased_finetuned.
